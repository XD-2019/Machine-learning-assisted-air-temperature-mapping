# Machine learning-assisted air temperature mapping

Code for the paper "Machine learning-assisted mapping of city-scale air temperature: Using sparse meteorological data for urban climate modeling and adaptation"

Modify the code according to your data and geographical grid structure. You may need to normalize your data if you are using regression algorighms like random forest.

If you are using code or it is helpful in your paper, please cite this paper[1].
